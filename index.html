The idea worked fine initially but ultimately didn't reach the expectation & just in a few months due to lack of traffics the website got closed permanently.</p>

					<h3>Starting of blogging</h3>

					<p>In the same year, Rajdeep started his personal blog on WordPress.com, mostly on cyber-security, web technology and a little bit about trending techn-news. The blog started grabbing attention from the people of same blogging commnunity on WordPress.com. Seeing his writings were getting huge responses, the next idea was inherited to start an official blog seperatedly from his personal blog. In February, 2018 he launched his first official blog with a brand name "TheTechLearner" on the WordPress subdomain. </p>

					<p>TheTechLearner was initially focused on sharing cyber-news, trending technology updates but unfortuanately it was not working on the ground as expected.

					<p>Things were started changing just after a few months when he published a special series of blogs with the title "How to start a blog" which was intended to guide newbiews who are equally interested to start their own blog. This series of blogs was included with not only the technical aspects of blogging but also covering the necessity to learn the importance of organic growth hack. After having a long way of sharing the series in threads across different social media handles fequently, finally it got its deserving outcome within 3 months and gained 1M+ views in all over. </p>

					<p>The next thing was happened when he started answering to the questions regarding blogging tips and solutions asked by the aspirant bloggers on Quora.com. Quora was his first and the smartest way to promote TheTechLearner and its series of blogs by writing answers on the same niche he usually does on his series and then backliking his relevant blogs in each of those answers. He got 60K+ views in those 100+ question-answerings.</p>

					<p>In between that he got in touch with several other third party ad & marketing camps and his blogs got more & more promotions & in 2019 he became the part of IndiBlogger: India's Biggest blog directly and the largest blogging community with most active bloggers in India.
