					<h2>Career</h2>
					<p>Rajdeep has completed his internship at Cognizant Technology Solutions in the Oracle Solution Practice domain in July, 2022 and in August 2022 he joined there as a full time employee in EAS Oracle Apps Solution Developer role. Before internship at Cognizant, Rajdeep has done few remotely held training & internship programs at several oraganizations/startup companies and serially earned letter of recommendations, certificate of recognitions & letter of appreciations.</p>

					<p>During his graduation period, Rajdeep first started a website with the name "WebTex" by taking a third party free hosting service in 2017 to provide free learning resources on Web Designing & Developing especially for school children & beginners by collecting study materials from different other resources at the same place. The idea worked fine initially but ultimately didn't reach the expectation & just in a few months due to lack of traffics the website got closed permanently.</p>

					<div id="Starting_of_blogging">

					<h3>Starting of blogging</h3>

					<p>In the same year, Rajdeep started his personal blog on WordPress.com, mostly on cyber-security, web technology and a little bit about trending tech-news. The blog started grabbing attention from the people of same blogging community on WordPress.com. Seeing his writings were getting huge responses, the next idea was inherited to start an official blog seperatedly from his personal blog. In February, 2018 he launched his first official blog with a brand name "TheTechLearner" on the WordPress subdomain. </p>

					<p>TheTechLearner was initially focused on sharing cyber-news, trending technology updates but unfortunately it was not working on the ground as expected. Because of his same taste of technical contents had already made a position through his personal blog, so his officially 'branded' blog was not getting the same responses. </p>

				</div>

				<div id="Turning_point_in_blogging">
				<h3>Turning point in blogging</h3>

					<p>Things were started changing just after a few months when he published a special series of blogs with the title "How to start a blog" which was intended to guide newbies who are equally interested to start their own blog. This series of blogs was included with not only the technical aspects of blogging but also covering the necessity to learn the importance of organic growth hack. After having a long way of sharing the series in threads across different social media handles frequently, finally it got its deserving outcome within 3 months and gained 1M+ views in all over. </p>

					<p>The next thing was happened when he started answering to the questions regarding blogging tips and solutions asked by the aspirant bloggers on Quora.com. Quora was his first and the smartest way to promote TheTechLearner and its series of blogs by writing answers on the same niche he usually does on his series and then backliking his relevant blogs in each of those answers. He got 60K+ views in those 100+ question answers.</p>

					<p>In between that he got in touch with several other third party ad & marketing camps and his blogs got more & more promotions & in 2019 he became the part of IndiBlogger: India's Biggest blog directly and the largest blogging community with most active bloggers in India. Rajdeep promoted both of his blogs (personal + TheTechLearner) on IndiBlogger & shared with other bloggers. Both of the blogs were ranked 72 and 54 respectively.</p>

					<p>According to IndiBlogger's most demanded popular blog-directory statistics since 2019, Rajdeep was listed among Top 10 Cyber Security bloggers, Top 200 Education bloggers, Top 100 WordPress bloggers. In the same year, Rajdeep was in the list Top 44th technical content writers in Expert-voted category in GeeksforGeeks Technical Scripter event- A national level event and in that same event of 2020 he was among Top 100 in Hard-voted category.   </p>

					<p>In 2019, Rajdeep created another sub-blog (child-blog) named HackiTalki-WikiWeb while keeping TheTechLearner as parent blog on the WordPress subdomain.</p> HackiTalki-WikiWeb is totally focused on sharing cyber-tech news, cyber crime & cyber security awareness program. </p>

					<p>Rajdeep also started a technews portal and tech-quiz portals in both of his blogs and it was apparently successful on social platforms. Since 2019, Rajdeep was not so able to frequently publish blogs due to his academic and career-pressure but he has made a strong presence of his blogs on social media platforms with massive response.</p>

					<p>In 2021, Rajdeep created two open source forum on GitHub Organization profiles in the name of his blogs where any people can contribute open source projects or ideas which was considered to be a great movement for open source enthusiasts.</p>

					<p>By the end of 2020, both of his blogs were profiled on Crunchbase public forum with popular choice blogs in India.</p>

					<p>From 2019 to 2021 he consistently wrote many technical and digital marketing related articles, case studies including guest blogging, freelancing for writing industries, event based competitive writing & few research journals in the name of edutech industries. He has also published technical reports & presentations on both ResearchGate & ResearchID respectively.</p>
